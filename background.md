# Non-Ergodic Systems

[Erogodicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodicity) (or lack thereof) in
random systems can lead to counter-intuitive results.  I became interested in
ergodicticity after reading the book "Skin in the Game" by Nassim Nicholas
Taleb.  The book discusses the concept of ergodicity in the context of risk and
decision-making.  When dealing with systems with some randomness baked in, it is
quite crucial to understand if we can say something about all such systems by
looking at the lifetime of only one instance.  If the system is ergodic then we
can. However if the principle of ergodicity does not hold for a system then a
particular instance can behave quite differently than what is suggested by the
average of all such systems.

The wealth simulator shows one such system based on an equation called "the
equation of life".  This equation is a contrived example of a non-ergodic
system. I first came across this particular example in the videos on the YouTube
channel "Erogodicity TV".
