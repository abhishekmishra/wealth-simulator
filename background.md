Erogodicity (or lack thereof) in random systems can lead to counter-intuitive results.
The wealth simulator on this site is based on a contrived example of a non-ergodic system.
I became interested in ergodicticity after reading the book "Skin in the Game" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
The book discusses the concept of ergodicity in the context of risk and decision-making.
I first came across this particular example in the videos on the YouTube channel "Erogodicity TV".
